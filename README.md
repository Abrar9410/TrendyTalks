# **BPL-Dream Squad Builder**

This project will give you a wonderful experience of building your dream cricket team. This was built for an assignment given by my Programming-Hero instructors. This is one of my earliest projects using React.js framework. I also used TailwindCSS & DaisyUI to help with the styling.


## **Technologies used:**

   * React.js
   * Tailwind CSS
   * DaisyUI
   * React-Toastify


## **Key Features of the project:**

   * 1) You can select 6 different players out of 10 available players after claiming some free credit.
   * 2) There will be a warning toast message if you exceed the limit of your budget.
   * 3) There will be a warning if you want to select same player twice.
   * 4) You can see your selected players as a list in the 'selected' tab.
   * 5) You can easily switch between the 'Available Players' tab & the 'Selected Players' tab by toggling the designated buttons.
