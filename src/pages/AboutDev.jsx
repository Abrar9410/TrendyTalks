            Hi, Abrar Shahriar here! I am a passionate web development enthusiast and a proud student of
            Programming-Hero.<br/><br/>
            From a deep love for Mathematics to finding my creative calling in web
            development, my journey has been anything but conventional. I initially pursued
            a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Mathematics at the University of Chittagong, driven by my
            fascination with problem-solving and logical thinking. Despite performing well
            academically, I gradually realized that traditional education didn't fuel my
            desire for creativity. However, those years introduced me to programming
            through minor courses involving Mathematica and Fortran, sparking my interest
            in coding.<br /><br />
            After much contemplation, I decided to dive into web development, a field
            that beautifully combines problem-solving with creative expression. At first,
            I explored various technologies independently but struggled to maintain focus.
            Everything changed when a friend introduced me to Programming Hero. Under the
            mentorship of Mr. Jhankar Mahbub, one of Bangladesh's leading developers,
            I received structured guidance, completed the course with excellent marks, and
            emerged as a junior frontend developer focused on the MERN stack.<br /><br />
            My expertise now spans React.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and more. I am
            currently expanding my knowledge by learning Next.js to stay at the forefront
            of modern web technologies.<br /><br />
            Beyond coding, I am passionate about sports and
            gaming. I had the honor of being part of the champion team in a tape tennis
            cricket tournament during my university years and played 2nd Division cricket
            for Chittagong Cricket Academy.<br /><br />
            My journey is fueled by a relentless desire to grow, solve complex problems,
            and create seamless, user-centric web applications that make a difference.
